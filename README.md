### Scripts

* RAS.py This file will generate RAS and immune dynamics and dose response to ueACE2

* RAS_patient_data_prediction.py This file predict initial ueACE2 to explain both increase and decrease in RAS peptides

* RAS_local_sensitivity_parameters.py This file generate time dynamic sensitivity for model parameters

* RAS_local_sensitivity_variables.py This file generate time dynamic sensitivity for model variables

* ueACE2_200.p - ueACE2_2000.p and ueACE2t are data file for ACE2 dynamics from the agent-based model
